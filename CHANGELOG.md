# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- **GitHub community & CI support files** — dependabot config (npm + web + Actions), pull-
  request template with the determinism/boundary/contract checklist, issue-template config
  (discussions + docs links), and a **profile-proposal issue form** mirroring the crew form
- **Profile marketplace publishing** — `publishProfile()` writes `items/<slug>.json` + a
  `kind: "profile"` catalog entry through the GitHub Contents API (Git-as-database, same
  two-commit reviewable flow as crews); `profileProblems()` is the deterministic CI gate
- **Marketplace proposal pipeline accepts profiles** — the `crew-submission` workflow now
  extracts CREW-JSON *or* PROFILE-JSON blocks, validates with the matching deterministic
  validator, and publishes either kind on maintainer `/publish`
- **Professional Agent Profiles** — the core new primitive: a portable, structured,
  versioned definition of how an AI agent operates as a professional. Equip an existing
  coding agent with a profession in one command:
  `proagent detect` → `proagent list` → `proagent equip security-engineer`
- **Profile compiler + harness adapters** (`src/adapters/`) — filesystem-driven detection
  of Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, Gemini CLI (env signals promote the primary);
  compilation into the target's strongest mechanisms: skills directory, marked project-
  instructions block (idempotent, content-hashed markers), native rule enforcement via
  hooks where supported. Limitations are reported, never papered over
- **13 built-in profiles** (`profiles/*.json`) — senior/staff/principal engineer, backend,
  frontend, security, performance, database, devops, SRE, QA, accessibility, systems
  architect
- **Deterministic composition engine** (`src/profiles/composition.ts`) — merge profiles
  into one effective operating model; conflicting rules (PA022) and incompatible tools
  (PA023) block; capability gaps (PA025) and duplicates (PA026) warn
- **Profile validation** (`proagent validate --profiles`, PA03x codes) — required fields,
  kebab-case slugs, semver, non-empty expertise/tools/verification, required-vs-forbidden
  tool contradictions, duplicate slugs
- **Marketplace profiles** — `kind: "profile"` catalog items; `equip` resolves slugs from
  the registry or fetches them from the Git-backed catalog; profile detail renderer in
  the marketplace SPA
- **New CLI commands** — `detect`, `list`, `inspect <profile>`, `equip`, `compile
  --target`, `validate --profiles`; all JSON-first (`--json`)
- Skill (`proagent`) rewritten around the two product paths: equip-a-profile first,
  build-a-specialized-agent second; new `references/profiles.md`
- Docs: new Professional Profiles guide, rewritten hero/what-is/getting-started, CLI
  reference split into profile and agent-building commands

### Changed

- Product framing: ProAgents equips existing coding agents with professions; the
  progressive interview (init/question/answer/spec/build) is the second path for creating
  new professional systems
- `validate --profiles` extends (does not replace) architecture validation

## [0.5.3] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- **`init` prompt no longer hangs in a real terminal** — the interactive prompts read
  stdin to EOF (`for await (const chunk of process.stdin)`), which deadlocks on a TTY
  because terminal stdin never ends. Prompts now resolve on the first line
  (`src/cli/interactive.ts`), with regression tests simulating a held-open stdin.

### Added

- **Standalone-use warning** — ProAgents is designed to be driven by an AI agent; when
  run interactively (stdin+stdout TTY, no `--json`, non-informational command) the CLI
  prints a one-time stderr hint to delegate to an agent with the skill
  (`npx skills add EnzoVezzaro/proagents`). Silenced by `PROAGENT_STANDALONE=1`.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- **Repo-aware `init`** — running `proagent init` without `--intent` in an existing repo
  scans it deterministically (manifests, README, structure, CI, tests, MCP config, agent
  skills), proposes a repo-derived intent, and pre-seeds the facts the repo already answers;
  the interview only asks genuine gaps (non-TTY auto-accepts the proposal). Engine now
  skips questions whose *categories* are already covered by seeded facts. New
  `src/core/repo-scan.ts` + 4 tests (`BENCH-REPO-SCAN-*`), including a determinism test
  that caught per-scan ID leakage.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- README: **Working in an existing repo** — running `proagent init` at the root of an
  existing codebase (grounded questions via `--context`, the interview loop, scoped context
  retrieval, `spec`/`validate`/`build` in place), what the session reads deterministically
  from the repo, and the GUI equivalent (`Build a crew → Start from your repo`)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- **Two-path crew builder** — `Build a crew` now offers: (1) *start from your repo* — a
  deterministic analyzer turns the repo's file tree into a grounded starter crew (suggested
  workers with reasons, real context scopes, handoffs), fully editable afterwards; (2)
  *build it custom* — empty crew, full control
- **Issue-based marketplace publishing** — publishing files a `crew-proposal` GitHub issue
  (from the builder or `proagent crew submit`); the new `Crew proposal pipeline` workflow
  validates the embedded JSON with the deterministic validator and posts the verdict, and a
  maintainer `/publish` (write-gated) commits it to the catalog. `/close` rejects. Issue
  form template included; nothing goes live without human review
- SPA craft pass: global focus-visible rings, button hover/active feedback, skeleton
  loading states for the catalog, refined type ramp and shared design tokens

### Changed

- The builder's Ship tab now leads with *local install* (download JSON + copy CLI command)
  before *marketplace proposal*; direct SPA commits to the catalog were removed in favor of
  proposals
- Marketplace guide rewritten around the two build paths and the proposal pipeline

## [0.4.1] - 2026-09-15

### Removed

- **Stripe & per-crew pricing** — the project is fully open source with donations only
  (GitHub Sponsors + Ko-fi). Removed `pricing`/`checkoutUrl` from crew definitions and the
  catalog schema, the `crew checkout` command, all Stripe env vars, and every pricing UI
  (catalog cards, detail buy button, builder pricing tab). All listings are free · MIT.

### Added

- **`.env` / `.env.example`** — all credentials centralized in a gitignored `.env` with a
  committed template; `.gitignore` now keeps `!.env.example` tracked
- Dependency-free `.env` loader for the CLI (walks up to the nearest `.env`/`.env.local`,
  then falls back to user-global `~/.proagent/.env`; real environment variables always win)
- SPA build-time config from root `.env` (`envDir: ..`): `VITE_GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID`,
  `VITE_MARKET_REPO`, `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` replace hardcoded values
- Donation links in the marketplace app (header ♥ Donate button, footer, detail page,
  builder ship tab) — Sponsors + Ko-fi, no payment processor in the codebase
- 7 env tests (parsing, precedence, directory walk-up, global fallback, sensitivity classes)
- `npm run gh:token` — one-command GitHub App device-flow token refresh: prints a code,
  waits for authorization at `github.com/login/device`, verifies identity and writes
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` into the gitignored `.env`

### Changed

- `crew publish` tokens and repo now resolve from env/`.env` (`GITHUB_TOKEN`,
  `PROAGENT_MARKET_REPO`) — flags still override

### Added

- **Crews & marketplace** — publishable bundles of specialized workers (skill + permission
  model + tool allowlist + MCP servers + context bindings + artifact-passing handoff graph)
- `proagent crew` CLI: `list`, `show`, `validate`, `install` (the one-liner: pulls a crew
  into the repo you run it in — writes `.agents/crews/<id>/` skills/contracts and merges
  `.mcp.json`), `publish` (commits to the Git-backed catalog via the GitHub Contents API)
- Deterministic crew validation: permission vocabulary, unknown MCP/upstream references,
  handoff-artifact integrity, acyclicity (DAG) — invalid crews are refused at install,
  publish and download time
- **Marketplace web app** (static SPA on GitHub Pages at `/app/`): catalog browsing,
  crew detail with permission badges, **crew builder GUI** (the CLI interview as forms,
  exporting the same `CrewDefinition` JSON), **preview-on-repo** (sign in, pick a repo, run
  a crew on the fly with your own provider/model, install it via the GitHub API), settings
  modal (provider/model/key, GitHub token, Clerk publishable key) — everything stored in
  the browser's localStorage, zero backend
- **Git-as-database catalog** (`.marketplace/`): reads are static same-origin fetches,
  writes are reviewable commits through the GitHub Contents API (GitRows pattern); three
  seed listings (2 crews + 1 agent)
- **GitHub Device Flow auth** in the browser (ProAgents GitHub App client id only — no
  client secret in the bundle) with PAT fallback
- **Stripe Payment Links** for paid crews: sandbox link minted for the seed paid crew;
  checkout happens on Stripe's domain, the static site never holds a secret key
- 19 new tests (CREW-VALIDATE/INSTALL/REGISTRY/CLI), 159 total, all offline

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- **New benchmark styles** (closing the `test`/`patch`/`predicate` style gap):
  - `test_execution` — declared tests must be run via the `test_runner` tool and results
    recorded honestly (`must_run`/`must_pass`); skipped or hidden failures fail deterministically
  - `patch_apply` — recorded unified-diff patches must transform base fixtures into golden
    fixtures (in-memory LCS diff engine with context-tolerant hunk application, no code execution)
  - `artifact_predicate` — content assertions on artifacts: `contains` / `not_contains` /
    `matches` (regex, validated at load time) / `min_length`
  - `approval_required` — approval-gated tools require a granted human-approval event first
- **Three new shipped benchmark suites** in `.agents/benchmarks/`:
  - `api-contract-validator` — 5 schema-driven, judge-free cases (conformance, missing fields,
    secret leakage, invalid payloads, broken contracts)
  - `migration-reviewer` — 4 cases over SQL fixtures (destructive-op detection, patch-style
    reviewed-migration reproduction, test-style verification)
  - `incident-responder` — 4 multi-agent cases (triage/comms/remediation participation,
    handoff integrity, approval-gated restart)
- New reference agents: `patch-agent`, `wrong-patch-agent`, `test-runner-agent`,
  `test-skipper-agent`, and the case-adaptive multi-agent `responder-team`
- Structured suite expectations: `required_fields`, `output_schema`, `output_artifact`,
  `required_agents` (case- and suite-level), `tests`, `patch`, `predicates`, `approvals` —
  all validated at load time with precise `BENCHMARK_CONFIG_ERROR` messages
- Suite-relative fixture loading with fixture hashes in the run manifest
- 35 new tests (BENCH-PATCH/TEST/PRED/APPROVAL/RED/SCORE/SUITE/RUN/SHIPPED), 140 total, all offline

### Fixed

- Secret redaction corrupted benchmark data: an unanchored `pass` pattern redacted the
  ordinary key `passed` (and test results) to `[REDACTED]`; pattern is now substring-safe
  (`password|passwd` spelled out) while still matching compounds like `accessToken`
- Unified-diff parsing created a phantom context line from trailing newlines, breaking
  round-trip application of generated diffs
- Weighted metrics that were never evaluated defaulted to 0, silently punishing cases that
  declared no checks for that metric; they now default to a **vacuous pass (1.0)** with
  explicit provenance (`semantic_quality` stays 0 — semantic silence is not excellence)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- **Benchmark subsystem** (`proagent benchmark`): deterministic-first evaluation of
  generated agent systems — execution traces with secret redaction and tamper seals,
  10 deterministic evaluators (artifact/schema/fields/forbidden/permission/handoff/
  participation/trace/output), pluggable judge providers with strict rubric-bound
  prompts and evidence validation, consensus analysis with disagreement detection,
  deterministic-first adjudication, weighted scoring with full provenance and
  confidence kept separate from score, repeated runs with flaky detection, run
  manifests for reproducibility, baselines and per-metric/per-case regression gates
- Benchmark CLI: `list`, `create`, `validate`, `run` (`--case`, `--runs`, `--agent`,
  `--deterministic`), `report`, `compare`, `baseline create`, `regressions`,
  `inspect`, `evaluators` — all with `--json`
- Example `production-debugger` suite: 9 cases (success, incomplete context,
  contradictory requirements, forbidden production write, incorrect fix, missing
  artifact, invalid handoff, noisy logs, regression), 2 rubrics, 3 judges
- Reference agents for testing the benchmark: perfect, incorrect, partial, unsafe,
  malformed, no-op, flaky, nondeterministic, cheating
- Offline built-in judge providers (`builtin-deterministic`, `builtin-semantic`,
  `builtin-safety`) — CI needs no network or API keys
- 81 benchmark tests across unit / integration / adversarial / metamorphic / e2e
  layers with stable `BENCH-*` ids, including the GOOD-vs-BAD-vs-CHEATING
  classification challenge
- Sponsor/donate support: GitHub Sponsors + Ko-fi buttons (README, docs footer,
  FUNDING.yml, license page)
- Docs: benchmarking guide, benchmark-testing guide, CLI reference section

### Fixed

- CLI version is read from `package.json` at runtime — the published 0.1.1 binary
  incorrectly reported 0.1.0 (found by dogfooding the published package)
- Strictly read-only systems are no longer planned as implementer/operator teams; the
  single-vs-team decision honors the declared permission polarity, while explicit
  multi-agent requests still produce teams restricted to read-only roles
- Filesystem context retrieval ignores common English stopwords that caused irrelevant
  snippets (e.g. matching on "and")
- Benchmark: `artifact_schema` now validates *declared* artifacts (missing artifacts
  no longer pass vacuously) and the no-op agent fails multiple checks as intended
- Benchmark: `tool_discipline` now receives deterministic signals
  (permission/forbidden-tool findings), so fully deterministic runs can reach 100
- Benchmark: flaky reference agent emits contract-compliant JSON on passing runs so
  flakiness detection works against JSON contracts

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-15

### Changed

- Release workflow now publishes via npm trusted publishing (OIDC) — no long-lived
  `NPM_TOKEN` secret required for releases after this one

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- Progressive question engine: deterministic derivation, topic-triggered follow-ups,
  contradiction detection with explicit resolution, coverage/confidence/readiness scoring
- Persistent session state in `.proagent/session.json` (resumable, inspectable)
- Context Framework API with `filesystem` and `git` builtin adapters
- Optional `agents-code-context` (ACC) adapter — available when the `acc` CLI is installed,
  never a hard dependency
- External framework loading from local paths and git URLs
- Agent specification generation: single agent or derived team with roles, permissions,
  approval gates, escalation and validation criteria
- Agent graph with handoffs (named artifacts), delegation, review, aggregation and
  escalation edges; parallelism flags
- Deterministic architecture validation (`PA0xx` codes); build blocks on errors
- `proagent build` — generates specialized agent skills
  (`.agents/skills/<agent>/SKILL.md` + `references/` + `agent.json`)
- Runtime capability detection with honest gap reporting (provider-agnostic)
- Self-improvement configuration (frequencies, propose/supervised/auto policies,
  immutable constraint set)
- JSON-first CLI: `init`, `status`, `question`, `answer`, `context`, `spec`, `validate`,
  `build`, `agents`, `inspect`, `improve` — all with deterministic `--json` output
- Shipped `proagent` agent skill (SKILL.md + references, progressive disclosure)
- VitePress documentation site (ink/cream/lime brand) with GitHub Pages deployment
- CI (test matrix + docs build), npm release workflow with provenance
- Full test suite covering engine, context, session, runtime and validation
